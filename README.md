Coding Question

Part 1.

Please write a function isPalindrome that takes a string of characters and returns true if that string is a palindrome, false if not. This function should be case-insensitive, uppercase letters should be treated the same as lowercase ones ("rAcecar" should return true).

A palindrome is a string where, if reversed, the letters are still the same: 'racecar', 'eevee', 'asdffdsa'

Part 2.

Update isPalindrome so that it now ignores space characters - 'race car' and 'nurses run' are palindromes.

Part 3.

Write another function that uses isPalindrome. This function should take in a string and return the length of the longest palindrome within that string.
You are free to make changes to isPalindrome if needed.

'asdffffgh' should return 4, because the longest palindrome is 'ffff'.
'that is a nice race car' should return 8, because the longest palindrome is 'race car'.
